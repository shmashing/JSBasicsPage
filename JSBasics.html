        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Variable Declaration</div>
            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
            <div id="inline_ex">var x;</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Variable Assignment</div>
            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
            <div id="inline_ex">var x = 10;</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Data Types</div>
            Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -
            <div id="inline_ex">true</div>
            or 
            <div id="inline_ex">false;</div>
            null -
            <div id="inline_ex">null</div>
            aka nothing; Number -
            <div id="inline_ex">42</div>
            or
            <div id="inline_ex">3.14159;</div>
            String -
            <div id="inline_ex">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</div>
            Array -
            <div id="inline_ex">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</div>
            and Object -
            <div id="inline_ex">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Conditionals</div>
            When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values of conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. These are the following conditional statements: 
            <div id="inline_ex">if</div>
            a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
            <div id="inline_ex">else if</div>
            to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
            <div id="inline_ex">else</div>
            we execute this block of code;
          </li>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Loops</div>
            There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
          </li>
          <li>
            <div id="section_head">Functions</div>
            Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instruction. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
